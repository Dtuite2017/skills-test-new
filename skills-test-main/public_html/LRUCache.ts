// You have a memory unit (cache) that can only hold 3 items at once.
// Items are loaded from disk into the cache for faster access.
// Items are loaded only when requested and should not be loaded before a request is made.
// If the cache is full, the least recently accessed item should be removed and the new value should be placed in the cache.


// Write a program to implement the functionality of the cache.

// NOTE: Don't use/assume any structures that retain the order of insertion.
